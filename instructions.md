How to Set Up and Deploy Email Notifications
This guide will walk you through setting up the backend function that sends daily email reminders. This requires using the command line (or the Terminal in VS Code).

Prerequisites
Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can get it from nodejs.org.

Firebase Account: You already have this from the previous steps.

SendGrid Account: You'll need a free account to send emails.

Step 1: Set Up Your Project Folder
Create a new folder on your computer for your project.

Inside that folder, place your customer-follow-up.html file.

Create a new sub-folder inside called functions.

Inside the functions folder, save the index.js file I provided.

Your folder structure should look like this:

/my-follow-up-app
  ├── customer-follow-up.html
  └── /functions
      └── index.js

Step 2: Install Firebase CLI and Initialize Your Project
Open a terminal (like cmd, PowerShell, or the VS Code terminal) and navigate into your main project folder (my-follow-up-app).

Install the Firebase CLI by running this command:

npm install -g firebase-tools

Log in to Firebase:

firebase login

This will open a browser window for you to log in to your Google account.

Initialize Firebase in your project:

firebase init

When prompted "Which Firebase features do you want to set up?", use the arrow keys to select Firestore and Functions. Press spacebar to select, then Enter to confirm.

Choose "Use an existing project" and select your Firebase project (slaters-dee11 or similar).

It will ask about Firestore rules. You can press Enter to accept the default (firestore.rules).

For Functions, choose JavaScript as the language.

When asked "Do you want to use ESLint?", you can type N for No to keep it simple.

When asked "Do you want to install dependencies with npm now?", type Y for Yes. This will take a minute to install the necessary packages.

Step 3: Configure SendGrid
Sign up for a free SendGrid account at sendgrid.com.

Create a Sender Identity. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication. You must verify a "single sender" email address. This is the address the emails will come from. You will have to click a verification link in your inbox. This is a critical step.

Get your API Key. Go to Settings > API Keys. Click "Create API Key", give it a name (e.g., firebase-function), choose "Full Access", and create it. Copy this key immediately and save it somewhere safe. You will not be shown it again.

Step 4: Install Dependencies and Set API Key
Navigate into the functions folder in your terminal:

cd functions

Install the SendGrid package:

npm install @sendgrid/mail

Set your SendGrid API key as an environment variable for your Firebase project. Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with the key you copied from SendGrid.

firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

Step 5: Deploy the Function
You are now ready to deploy! Make sure you are in the main project directory (my-follow-up-app), not the functions sub-directory.

cd .. 

Run the deploy command:

firebase deploy --only functions

This process will take a few minutes. Once it's done, your dailyEmailCheck function will be live and will run automatically every morning at 8 AM. You can check on its status and logs in the "Functions" section of your Firebase Console.
